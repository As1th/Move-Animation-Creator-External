# Move-Animation-Creator

This application allows you to create your own move animations by combining and manipulating existing animations.

## Selecting a Background
A dropdown list is provided with all the backgrouds for you to choose from. Below are some details on the options provided

**Default**
* With this option, whatever animation you choose to combine will have it's default background. For example Confusion will have the Psychic Background, Shadow Ball will have the Ghost background etc

**No/Remove Background**
* This option will remove any background from an animation. This includes both regular backgrounds like Shadow Ball and colored backgrounds like Absorb. Some moves cannot have their backgroud removed. A list of moves that can't have their background removed will be listed below. Any attempt to do so will be ignored

**Abbreviations**
* CR: Colored Background can not be removed. Any attempt to do so will be ignored. You can still add a background to it
