# Move-Animation-Creator

This application allows you to create your own move animations by combining and manipulating existing animations. You can combine up to 4 move animations 

## Selecting a Background
A dropdown list is provided with all the backgrouds for you to choose from. Below are some details on the options provided

**Default**
* With this option, whatever animation you choose to combine will have it's default background. For example Confusion will have the Psychic Background, Shadow Ball will have the Ghost background etc

**No/Remove Background**
* This option will remove any background from an animation. This includes both regular backgrounds like Shadow Ball and colored backgrounds like Absorb. Some moves cannot have their backgroud removed. A list of moves that can't have their background removed will be listed below. Any attempt to do so will be ignored

**High Impact, Guillotine and Solarbeam**
* These moves use different backgrounds depending on who is attacking (you or CPU). This application automatically uses the correct the background depending on who's attacking so you don't have to worry about it

## Background Scroll
Some backgrounds are scrollable such as the Thunder background. If you choose to have a scrolling background, the entire animation from start to finish will have it's background scrolled (even if the background gets switched) 

## Scroll Speed
This setting will effect how fast the background will scroll vertically/horizontally. This setting has no effect if "No Scroll" is selected for the Background Scroll

## Animations to Combine
You can combine up to 4 animations together. Select the move(s) you want to use/combine with the dropdown list. Some moves have an abbreviation. The following list will explain what they mean

**Abbreviations**

* CR: Colored Background can not be removed. Any attempt to do so will be ignored. You can still add a background to the move
* BR: Background cannot be removed. Any attempt to do so will be ignored. You can still replace it with another background
* BRR: Background cannot be removed or replaced. Any attempt to do so will be ignored

## Keep Background Checkbox
If you aren't using a Default Background (see above) and you want a move to keeps its background, check this box. For example: If I Select the background to be "Dark" and the moves I want to combine are Pursuit, Shadow Ball and Tackle, but I want Shadow Ball to kepp its Ghost background, I would check Keep Background for Shadow Ball. This is how the animation would look: 
Notice how Tackle uses the Ghost background. This is because when you select Keep background, all moves after it will use the background that you chose to keep. The best way to learn how this works is to play around with the application and create some test animations.
*It is NOT recommended to select Keep Background for more than 1 Psychic move. If you Select Keep Background for a Psychic move, every move after it will NOT have a background.
